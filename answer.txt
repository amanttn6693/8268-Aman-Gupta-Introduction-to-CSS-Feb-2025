Q1. What is the use of float property? Which property is the better alternative to it?
Ans.The float property in CSS is used to position elements to the left or right of their container, allowing other content to wrap around them. It's commonly used for layout purposes, especially when creating multi-column designs or wrapping text around images. However, using float for layout can cause issues like layout breaking, overlapping elements, and difficulties with clearing floats.

    Better alternative to float:
    The preferred alternative to the float property is the CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid. These layout models offer more control and flexibility, allowing for complex and responsive designs without the issues associated with floats.
    
        Flexbox: It allows for easy alignment of elements in rows or columns, with support for spacing, ordering, and resizing.
        Grid: Provides a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, giving full control over both rows and columns, making complex layouts simpler.

Q2. Explain the difference between absolute and relative positions.
Ans. The absolute and relative positioning properties in CSS define how an element is positioned in relation to its containing element or the entire page.

      Relative Positioning (position: relative):
          An element with position: relative is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
          The element still occupies its original space in the layout, and its position can be adjusted using the top, right, bottom, or left properties, but this does not affect the layout of other elements.
          Use case: Often used when you need to move an element from its default position without removing it from the document flow.
  
      Absolute Positioning (position: absolute):
          An element with position: absolute is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an element with position: relative, absolute, or fixed). If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the <html> element.
          The element is removed from the normal document flow, meaning it does not affect the position of other elements and will overlap them if necessary.
          Use case: Typically used for creating dropdown menus, tooltips, or other elements that need to be precisely positioned within a container.

Q3. What are the different types of CSS Selectors?
Ans. CSS selectors are used to select HTML elements and apply styles to them. There are several types of CSS selectors, each serving different purposes. Below are the key types of CSS selectors:
      1. Universal Selector (*)
      
          Selects all elements in the document.
          Example:
      
          * {
            color: red;
          }
      
          This will make the text color red for all elements.
      
      2. Type Selector (Element Selector)
      
          Selects all elements of a specific type.
          Example:
      
          p {
            font-size: 16px;
          }
      
          This will apply styles to all <p> elements.
      
      3. Class Selector (.)
      
          Selects elements with a specific class attribute.
          Example:
      
          .highlight {
            background-color: yellow;
          }
      
          This will style all elements with the class highlight.
      
      4. ID Selector (#)
      
          Selects a unique element with a specific id attribute.
          Example:
      
          #header {
            background-color: blue;
          }
      
          This will apply styles to the element with the id of header.
      
      5. Attribute Selector
      
          Selects elements based on the presence of an attribute or its value.
          Example:
      
          input[type="text"] {
            border: 1px solid gray;
          }
      
          This selects all <input> elements with the attribute type="text".
      
      6. Child Selector (>)
      
          Selects elements that are direct children of a specified element.
          Example:
      
          div > p {
            color: green;
          }
      
          This will apply the style to all <p> elements that are direct children of a <div>.
      
      7. Descendant Selector (Space)
      
          Selects elements that are descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of a specified element.
          Example:
      
          div p {
            color: blue;
          }
      
          This will apply the style to all <p> elements that are inside a <div>.
      
      8. Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
      
          Selects an element that is immediately next to a specified element.
          Example:
      
          h1 + p {
            margin-top: 0;
          }
      
          This will apply the style to the first <p> element that directly follows an <h1>.
      
      9. General Sibling Selector (~)
      
          Selects all elements that are siblings (not necessarily adjacent) of a specified element.
          Example:
      
          h1 ~ p {
            font-size: 18px;
          }
      
          This will apply the style to all <p> elements that are siblings of an <h1>.
      
      10. Pseudo-Classes (:)
      
          Selects elements based on their state or position, such as :hover, :first-child, or :nth-child.
          Example:
      
          a:hover {
            color: red;
          }
      
          This will change the color of links when hovered.
      
      11. Pseudo-Elements (::)
      
          Selects specific parts of an element, such as the first letter or first line.
          Example:
      
          p::first-letter {
            font-size: 2em;
          }
      
          This will style the first letter of every <p> element.
      
      12. Group Selector (,)
      
          Allows you to apply the same style to multiple selectors.
          Example:
      
      h1, h2, h3 {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      }
      
      This will apply the same font to <h1>, <h2>, and <h3> elements.


Q4. How are inline and block elements different from each other?
Ans. Here’s a concise comparison between inline and block elements:

      Display Behavior:
          Block Elements: Occupy the full width of their container, starting on a new line. Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>.
          Inline Elements: Only take up as much width as necessary, not starting on a new line. Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>.
  
      Height and Width:
          Block Elements: You can set width and height on block elements.
          Inline Elements: Height and width properties don't affect inline elements (they don’t behave as boxes).
  
      Layout Flow:
          Block Elements: Stack vertically, one on top of the other.
          Inline Elements: Flow horizontally, next to each other.
  
      Positioning:
          Block Elements: Can be styled with margin, padding, and borders on all sides (top, right, bottom, left).
          Inline Elements: Can only have horizontal margin and padding (left and right).
  
      Examples:
          Block Elements: <div>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>.
          Inline Elements: <span>, <a>, <em>, <strong>, <img>.
